## SafeButler's Sublease Agreement
### Made by real people for real people
Let’s be real: subleasing can be risky for all parties involved. **That’s where SafeButler’s sublease agreement comes in.** Written in plain English and easy to understand, this document serves as a written agreement between the formal leaseholder and sublessee for the expectations of the sublease term.

Everyone's sublease needs are different, so we've made this an open source file, meaning you can **edit it fit your specific needs.**

This sublease agreement is much more relatable and relevant than the one you were going to copy from Google. But it's also much more useful. Have plants you need taken care of while you're subletting your place? Included. Got things that you'd prefer your lovely sublessee not use? Taken care of. **All you have to do is fill in the blanks.**

Plus, if your sublessee falls short of any terms, there are **real consequences**, like owing you lunch or a replacement plant if they kill one.

THIS DOCUMENT IS INTENDED FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY AND DOES NOT SERVE AS A LEGALLY BINDING DOCUMENT NOR DOES IT COVER ALL LEGAL TERMS FOR SUBLETTING. CHECK YOUR STATE LAWS AND CODES FOR SUBLEASING REQUISITES.
